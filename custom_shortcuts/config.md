## Main Toolbox Options

"m\_toolbox \_duplicates": Takes functions and binds them to new shortcuts.

This object takes inputs of the form "(function keyword)":"(shortcut)", separated by commas. (e.g. {"m\_toolbox undo":"u","m\_toolbox study":"9"})

All the keywords are exactly the same as the keywords used in the json file, making the lines copy-pastable.

## Reviewer Options

"reviewer \_duplicates": Takes functions and binds them to new shortcuts.

This object takes inputs of the form "(function keyword)":"(shortcut)", separated by commas. (e.g. {"reviewer mark card":"]","reviewer flip card 1":"-"})

All the keywords are exactly the same as the keywords used in the json file, making the lines copy-pastable. (Those who want to remove the numbers from stuff like "reviewer flip card" can do so as well)

If you want to set more than one duplicate per shortcut for the reviewer, you can do so by adding the suffix "+++" *immediately* after the shortcut name followed by any distinct string. (e.g. {"reviewer flip card 3+++ first": "l", "reviewer flip card 3+++ 2nd": "t"})

## Add-on Preferences

**These options are for changing a few settings on the add-on itself.**

"Ω custom paste end style": For the exceptionally lazy (like me). If set to "y", inserts a `</span>` and a zero-width space at the end of the custom text to stop the custom style from bleeding into new text.

Otherwise, the custom paste will behave exactly like regular paste.

"Ω custom paste text": Controls what html will be pasted by "custom paste" in "editor \_extras"	
e.g. `"Ω custom paste text": "<span style=\"font-size: 20px; color:#3399ff\">◆</span>"`

"Ω enable main/window_browser/editor/etc.": If set to "n", doesn't enable the corresponding set of shortcuts for the respective functions (useful for addon compatability in a pinch)

"Ω enable conflict warning": If set to "y", shows a warning window whenever two shortcuts of the same type are set to the same key.
